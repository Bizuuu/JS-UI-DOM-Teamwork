## About the Project
Inspired by the upcoming movie `Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice` our team decided to make a game based on the rivalry of the two. We imagine the fight will take place in three main stages:

### The jumping/shooting level
Of course, they have to fight. Both have laser guns and can jump on the other's head. It's basically all the action you could want. The scene takes place somewhere between Gotham City and Krypton.

The gameplay's very simple:
**Left and right arrow keys** for Superman / **A and S** for Batman - now you can **walk**!
But wait - there's more - you can even jump! Use the **up arrow key** / **W** to do that.
If you want to **shoot** your enemy, do it with the **down arrow key** / **S**.
