## About the Project
Inspired by the upcoming movie `Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice` our team decided to make a game based on the rivalry of the two. We imagine the fight will take place in three main stages:

### The jumping/shooting level
Of course, they have to fight. Both have laser guns and can jump on the other's head. It's basically all the action you could want. The scene takes place somewhere between Gotham City and Krypton.

The gameplay's very simple:
**Left and right arrow keys** for Superman / **A and S** for Batman - now you can **walk**!
But wait - there's more - you can even jump! Use the **up arrow key** / **W** to do that.
If you want to **shoot** your enemy, do it with the **down arrow key** / **S**.

### The asteroids level
Yes, these two are usually great at saving mankind, but not today! They are so obsessed with their little competion that they forgot all about saving people, heroism and stuff... A huge meteor shower is comming towards the Earth and it's too late to do anything now. All they have to do is to save themselves by avoiding the meteors.

You know how to play it - jump and run from left to right like a maniac (then backwards)!

### The logic level
The Earth is destroyed, these two have serious burns from the previous two rounds and you would think they'll call it a day.
Well, think again! They've found a deserted store with nothing but boxes... so they decided to stack them.

It's pretty simple actually.
**Left and right arrow keys** / **A and D** to move the pointer to the **left or right** and **down arrow key** / **S** to drop a box at the current position. All you have to do is make sure the box you drop stays on the platform for the entire turn. Beware the gravity though... and the slippery surfaces.
